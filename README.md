# CountryCrossCode
iOS country guessing game

This is an XCode project for the iPhone which gets a list of country names from the Swift API ISO3166 list and prompts people to type in their guesses. The game tells them if the answer is alphabetically higher or lower than their guess, and by how many countries.

It has some colour formatting, retains scores, and other niceties, though can also stand to be improved in many ways. For one, the country names can be tricky. The full list is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes and you'll see some of these have "the" and so on. A simplified list may be better, with more traditional options.
